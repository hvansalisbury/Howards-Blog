## Usage

When you open the site, you can view all the posts and comments. However, if you would like to write, update, or delete a post or comment, you must have an account. You can sign up on the sign up page, which is linked under the login form. After signing up, you can login with the same login information. You can also update or delete your profile at any time. When you're logged in, the buttons for adding editing a post or comment, or adding a comment will appear. The option to write a new post is on the use dashboard.
